<h1>Movved is an app for watching movies. That's it. It is in progress...</h1>

<h3>Techs that will be used/utilized</h3>

- ReactJS (create-react-app)
- Redux (redux toolkit)
- Typescript (because I like it)
- Next JS (because why not, got enough of Express JS atm.)
- CSS Grids (grids seem cool and powerful.)
- SASS/LESS (these are often used, I will be learning and using them... well one of them in the app.)
