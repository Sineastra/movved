<h1>Movved is an app for watching movies. That's it. It is in progress...</h1>

<h2>The development of this app will be Test Driven. In other words: TDD.</h2>
- tests first, code built around the tests.


<h3>Techs that I will use/utilize</h3>

- ReactJS (create-react-app)
- Redux (redux toolkit)
- Typescript (because I like it)
- Next JS (because why not, got enough of Express JS atm.)
- CSS Grids (grids seem cool and powerful.)
- SASS
